This is suppposed to be a yeoman generator for me to kickstart quick experiments/prototypes not an open project. This is very opinionated to my own workflow.

## Todo
* add grunt file
* better documentation
* add server
* use libsass



### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-experiment-starter from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-experiment-starter
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo experiment-starter
```
